## XARITES THE CREATIVE AGENCY SRL

## _Automation workflow_

Created by [Vecsei Szilveszter](mailto:szilveszter@xarites.com) for [Xarites].

This is our workflow tool for automating a series of tasks.
We use Gulp + Webpack for fast development, here you will find a list of its features:

- Convert SASS to CSS
- Create source maps
- Combine css files
- Export SASS files to CSS files
- Export JS modules
- Bundle JS using webpack
- Compress images
- Convert images to WebP format
- Browser Sync

## üöÄ Tech

This tool must have the following to work properly:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - be sure to have installed, do a version check `node --version`.
- This tool was created long time ago, tested with node `v16` and `v17`

## Installation

- Copy this directory( `automation` ) in your `Plugin/Theme/WP root. `
- You can also install this plugin as it is, configure (`settings.js`) and run (`it has examples`).
- Navigate to automation directory and run `npm install`
- `All npm tasks will be executed from here!`

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

This tool has a settings file(`settins.js`), this is the only file you will need to edit.

| Settings            | README                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `appLocation`       | your plugin path                          |
| `appThemeLocation`  | your theme path                           |
| `urlToPreview`      | your local url of the project             |
| `adminUrlToPreview` | your local admin url of the project       |
| `env`               | your environment (development/production) |

## üßê Usage

> `For plugins üîå`

I assume you use a boilderplate, I adapted the file structure similar to [this one](https://wppb.me/).

- This tool is capable creating the file structure for you, hit:

```sh
npm run gulp-plugin-structure
```

- All you need to do is to `import and initialize all your modules` from your modules directory in `module-scripts.js`,
  the tool will create a `build` directory using webpack, and `automatically bundle all changes` you make.
- From this point you `load only` the bundle(`scripts-bundled.js`) from the build directory to the front-end.
- You can also manually create only the `js bundle` with `npm run gulp-scripts` for client side, and `npm run gulp-scripts-admin` for the admin side.

```sh
npm run gulp-scripts

npm run gulp-scripts-admin
```

For css it works the same way, `you create all your sass components` in the `modules directory`, and `include them` in the `module-scripts.scss` file.

- All the SASS files from modules will be converted to CSS and bundeled in the build directory, this can also be done manually with `npm run gulp-sass` for client side, and `npm run gulp-sass-admin` for the admin side.

```sh
npm run gulp-sass

npm run gulp-sass-admin
```

- You will `load only` the css bunle(`styles-bundle.css`) for the front-end.
- If for any particular reason, you need the conversion only of the css modules, you can use `npm run gulp-styles` for the public conversion, and `npm run gulp-styles-admin` for the admin conversion, you will find the converted files in the build directory.

```sh
npm run gulp-styles

npm run gulp-styles-admin
```

- This tool can compress/optimize images automatically.
- You can also run it manually for images in `public directory` and `admin-directory`

```sh
npm run gulp-compress-img

npm run gulp-compress-img-admin
```

- You can do the same thing for WebP conversions:

```sh
npm run gulp-convert-webp

npm run gulp-convert-webp-admin
```

Depending on where you work:

- Hit `gulp-watch` to start the tool on the client side (will listen to the `public directory`)
- Hit `gulp-watch-admin` to start the tool on the admin side (will listen to the `admin directory`)
- You can create subdirectories in the modules folders

```sh
npm run gulp-watch

npm run gulp-watch-admin
```

Watch without proxy:

- Hit `gulp-watch-compile` to watch changes you make on the `public directory`
- Hit `gulp-watch-compile-admin` to watch changes you make on the `admin directory`

```sh
npm run gulp-watch-compile

npm run gulp-watch-compile-admin
```

Global watcher:

- Hit `gulp-watch-all` to watch changes you make on the `public and admin directory` without proxy
- Hit `gulp-watch-all-sync` to watch changes you make on the `public and admin directory` with proxy

```sh
npm run gulp-watch-all

npm run gulp-watch-all-sync
```

> `For themes üíª`

Themes will use a simmilar structure like we have for plugins.
To create the file structure use:

```sh
npm run gulp-theme-structure
```

This will create the assets directory with 2 subdirectories (`admin` and `public`).
Everything is the same as I mentioned for plugins.

- You will `load only` the css bunle(`styles-bundle.css`) and the js bundle(`scripts-bundled.js`) from the theme build directories.

Depending on where you work:

- Hit `gulp-watch-theme` to start the tool on the client side (will listen to the `public directory`)
- Hit `gulp-watch-theme-admin` to start the tool on the admin side (will listen to the `admin directory`)

```sh
npm run gulp-watch-theme

npm run gulp-watch-theme-admin
```

Watch without proxy:

- Hit `gulp-watch-compile-theme` to watch changes you make on the `public directory`
- Hit `gulp-watch-compile-theme-admin` to watch changes you make on the `admin directory`

```sh
npm run gulp-watch-compile-theme

npm run gulp-watch-compile-theme-admin
```

Global watcher:

- Hit `gulp-watch-theme-all` to watch changes you make on the `public and admin directory` without proxy
- Hit `gulp-watch-theme-all-sync` to watch changes you make on the `public and admin directory` with proxy

```sh
npm run gulp-watch-theme-all

npm run gulp-watch-theme-all-sync
```

- If for any particular reason, you need the conversion only of the css modules, you can use `npm run gulp-styles-theme` for the public conversion, and `npm run gulp-styles-theme-admin` for the admin conversion, you will find the converted files in the build directory.

```sh
npm run gulp-styles-theme

npm run gulp-styles-theme-admin
```

- For manual creation of the `css bundle` you can use `npm run gulp-sass-theme` for client side and `npm run gulp-sass-theme-admin` for admin side.

```sh
npm run gulp-sass-theme

npm run gulp-sass-theme-admin
```

- For manual creation of the `js bundle` you can use `npm run gulp-scripts-theme` for client side and `gulp-scripts-theme-admin` for admin side.

```sh
npm run gulp-scripts-theme

npm run gulp-scripts-theme-admin
```

- This tool can compress/optimize images automatically.
- You can also run it manually for images in `public directory` and `admin-directory`

```sh
npm run gulp-compress-img-theme

npm run gulp-compress-img-theme-admin
```

- You can do the same thing for WebP conversions:

```sh
npm run gulp-convert-webp-theme

npm run gulp-convert-webp-theme-admin
```
